# Virtual Pet Adoption & Care Platform

A comprehensive C++ simulation developed for CS112 (Object-Oriented Programming). This platform provides an immersive experience where users can adopt, name, and nurture various species of virtual pets while engaging with gaming elements.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Pet Adoption & Customization:** Browse diverse pet species and give them unique names.
- **Dynamic Interaction:** Perform activities such as feeding, grooming, and playing.
- **Gaming Elements:** Progress through levels, earn rewards, and unlock achievements based on pet care quality.
- **Social & Educational:** Includes content on responsible pet ownership and animal welfare.

## 🛠️ OOP Concepts Implemented
- **Inheritance:** Models entities such as specific pet types (Cats, Dogs, Birds) and environments from base classes.
- **Polymorphism & Virtual Functions:** Enables dynamic pet behaviors and customized interactions.
- **Class Templates:** Utilized to create flexible, generic containers for managing collections of pets and activities.
- **Exception Handling:** Robust error management for invalid inputs and system reliability.

## 📊 System Architecture
The project follows a modular class structure to establish clear relationships between pets, users, items, and environments.

## 💻 Technical Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Interface:** Console-based User Interface (CUI)

## 📝 Usage
1. Compile all source files (e.g., `g++ main.cpp Pet.cpp -o VirtualPet`).
2. Run the executable.
3. Use the menu to adopt a pet and start interacting.
